This is the home of the Pitt Improved Study Spaces list.
As a student at the University of Pittsburgh, I am a bit dissatisfied at the lack of good study spaces during the middle of the day.
It appears that the University's official study spaces list is handwritten and some of the allocated blocks of time don't make much practical sense.
In response, I have built a bot that grabs all occuring classes from the PSMobile class search system and finds times when classrooms are likely to be open, or at the very least not occupied by a class.

This bot may not be as reliable as Pitt's own study spaces webpage. I do not know whether most of classrooms are used by Pitt staff for other purposes when classes are not in session. I will be trying to filter out some results that are clearly not merely classrooms, but I'm not very knowledgable of Pitt's campus as a first-year student.
